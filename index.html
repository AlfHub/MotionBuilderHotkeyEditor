<a id="instructions" class="anchor" href="#instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></a>Instructions:</span></h3>

1. Put the AW_HotkeyEditor.py script in your scripts folder OR copy the information into the Python Editor. Your choice.<br/>
2. Execute it.<br/>
3. For usage, see below.<br/>
4. Restart MotionBuilder. I'm sorry, but this part is out of my control. MB only registers the hotkeys on startup.

<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h3>
<p>
A GUI solution for MotionBuilder's lack of a hotkey editor that every other DCC has in some form.<br/>I thought that the Autodesk way of opening text files and editing them was really bad, so I tried to make it suck less.</p>
<h3>
<a id="what-it-does" class="anchor" href="#what-it-does" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it do?</h3>

<p>Long story short: The exact same thing as editing the files by hand, but hopefully better.<br/>It will create two files:
<pre><code>C:\Users\Me\Documents\MB\2015-x64\config\Keyboard\customHotkeys.txt
C:\Users\Me\Documents\MB\2015-x64\config\Keyboard\ActionScript.txt
</code></pre>You'll need to edit the directory paths near the top of the AW_HotkeyEditor.py file to reflect the version you have, be it 2014, 2015, or 2016. </p>
<h3>
<a id="which-window" class="anchor" href="#which-window" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Which window is which?</h3>

<p>The left table holds your actions and the key combination. Column 1 is where the desired action goes and column 2 is the key press sequence. If you want to edit the scripts, scroll down to action.global.script which is around line 180 for MotionBuilder hotkeys.</p>
The right table holds the script number (labeled corresponding to the action.global.script number from the left table). The path column holds either relative paths or full system paths.</p>

<h3>
<a id="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Okay, what else?</h3>
<p>You can use ANY of the settings for software as a starting point. Maya, 3DSMax, Softimage, etc - provided you haven't deleted them from your computer. I will be posting these files in the github repository in a folder called backup in case anybody doesn't have them.
By default, this will START with MotionBuilder hotkeys, but you can simply change this by going to the File menu in the top of the Hotkey Editor and selecting which one you want. As of right now, switching hotkey setups WILL NOT warn the user. I will build that in the future.</p>
<p>MotionBuilder will tell you if there's a conflict in hotkeys on startup. My best advice is to use the ALT key with combinations, it doesn't appear to be used as frequently as CTRL and SHFT.</p>
